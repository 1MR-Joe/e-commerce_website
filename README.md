# Learning
- Why specify the "Entity" and "Table" attributes ??
  - Entity attribute is required, it marks a PHP class as an entity to be persisted in the DB
  - while Table attribute is optional, it describes the table the entity is persisted in

# Project Future
- make a dynamic attributes system (suggested by [chatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/6713d5db-cf0d-47b4-93f0-305d9cbd7709))
- advanced filtering (i5, i7 CPUs for laptops)
- sub-categories (phones > [i-phone, Samsung, phone accessories])
- Complaints system (using UI and emails)
- sales tracking (store sales quantity)
- advanced CMS
- capacity for more employees (manger, supervisor, product manager, order manager)
- order tracking 
- Maybe add the feature of archiving products, for data analysis sake.
